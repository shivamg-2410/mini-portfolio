  <h2>Hello! Iâ€™m Shivam ðŸ‘‹</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate front-end developer, UI/UX enthusiast, and aspiring business developer based in India.
    I specialize in turning simple ideas into smart, responsive websites. I believe design should not only look good but also feel intuitive to the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside web development, Iâ€™m actively learning how businesses grow digitally and how good design contributes to stronger customer experiences.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My journey in web development began with a curiosity to understand how websites work behind the scenes.
    Today, I build interactive and mobile-responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also keep exploring UI/UX principles and design thinking approaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently, I completed a web development internship at <strong>Dinar Ventures</strong>, where I worked on building real projects in a professional environment.
    I was assigned multiple daily tasks including designing layouts, writing functional JavaScript, fixing bugs, and ensuring responsiveness. Under their mentorship, I learned how to manage code properly, follow deadlines, and improve my design thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    This internship was a great opportunity to apply what Iâ€™ve learned and also understand how small development decisions affect the user experience and business goals.
